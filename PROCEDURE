1. Setup Arduino:
- Connect the Arduino board to your computer and open the Arduino IDE.
- Install necessary libraries for the color sensor if required.
2. Assemble Hardware:
- Connect the color sensor module to the Arduino board according to the datasheet or instructions provided with the sensor.
- Connect the servo motors to the Arduino board. Each servo will control a sorting bin.
3. Calibrate the Color Sensor:
- Write a calibration code to determine the RGB values for each color you want to sort.
- Hold each color sample in front of the color sensor and record the corresponding RGB values. You may need to average readings to ensure accuracy.
4. Write Sorting Code:
- Write the code to read RGB values from the color sensor.
- Compare the measured RGB values with the calibrated values to determine the color of the object.
- Based on the color detected, command the servo motor(s) to move the sorting bin(s) to the appropriate position for that color.
5. Test and Debug:
- Upload the code to the Arduino board.
- Test the system with different colored objects to ensure accurate sorting.
- Debug any issues with sensor readings or servo movements.
6. Implement Sorting Mechanism:
- Construct the physical sorting mechanism using cardboard or similar material.
- Attach the servo motors to the sorting bins in a way that allows them to move the bins to the correct position based on the color detected.
- Ensure that the sorting bins are positioned to catch the objects as they are sorted.
7. Finalize and Refine:
- Fine-tune the code and hardware as needed for optimal performance.
- Consider adding additional features such as feedback mechanisms or user interfaces for monitoring and control.
8. Deployment:
- Once everything is working correctly, deploy your color-based sorting system for practical use.
- Monitor the system over time and make adjustments as necessary for maintenance and improvements.
